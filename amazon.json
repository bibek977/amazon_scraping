I had been wanting to get a laptop that had a dedicated graphics card, a backlit keyboard, good system specs, upgradeability, at a good price.", "Throw in the fact that Asus includes one year of ACCIDENT PROTECTION, and this is a winner!!", "  While only having this laptop for a couple of days (Edit: Weeks now) now, I am so far, not disappointed with the purchase.", "  Here are my initial impressions, the pros and the cons.", "  Pros:", "  Audio:  The onboard speakers are quite adequate.  While not some of the \"loudest\" they are more than needed for watching youtube, hearing system alerts, recreational music,  video calls, stuff like that.  I have not yet tried the speakers while gaming.  [Edit] Ok these speakers are definitely high volume.  Watching youtube, I have the speakers at 50% and the audio of the video at 5% !  And I'm worried that the people across the hall might be kept awake while I insomnia the night away.  Also for the fact that these are laptop speakers, the quality is REALLY good.  I've been listening to MP3s on this machine and its been quite satisfactory.  I had a soundbar on my older \"gaming\" laptop, because the speakers were crap.  Definitely not the case here.", "  The screen:  The screen is very good resolution, quite bright, and very comfortable to read on.  Whether in regular daylight, a lit room, or in the dark.  I have not yet tested it as far as gaming.", "  CON:  This screen is SMALL.  Coming from laptops with 17.3\" screens, this is quite an adjustment.  The screen does have very small, thin bezels, so it does a good job giving you the most screen for footprint.  However, as somebody who does a lot of video and text editing, this is not what I would really want.  If I were working with 3d models, I would definitely want an external monitor or two.", "  It also does NOT fold flat.  This is no problem at all for me.  But for those that are looking for a device that will do so, this is not it.  [Edit]  Finding the settings to adjust saturation, color balance, stuff like that, I can't find it!  And when I'm editing images, this screen has a very high yellow saturation.  So unless I can find, or download something that will let me see colors the way their meant to be, and external monitor is going to another costly expenditure.", "  Build Quality.  So far, this machine is quite sturdy.  The materials are good, and it doesn't feel like I am going to break it.  Or worry about having problems with it in my backpack.  Everything fits together very nicely.  Also when removing the bottom shell to get into the guts of the machine, I didn't feel like I was going to break it, or anything else, while using the spreader to pop the clips apart.  I do recommend the proper tool for the job tho.  Don't just try to jerk it apart after taking all those screws out.", "  Keyboard:  As with any new laptop, getting used to the key layout is almost always a chore.  There is no unified layout for the specialty keys.  For just typing, the layout is REALLY good.  The keys are spaced together Just Right, and doesn't cause me to make as many typos as my larger machines, where the keys are spaced further apart.", "  They are very tactile, and make very little noise.  They don't have the feel of mechanical keyswitches.  They may be membrane keys, or a combination.  [Edit]  Membrane keys.  I would rather have switches personally, as it's less to replace, if one key, or a couple of keys fail.  But they work really well in this machine.", "Other than when I have the machine sitting awkwardly on my lap, I have absolute NO problems typing on this, and can hit the keys that I'm aiming for quite intuitively, with very little in the way or typos induced by the machine.", "  The backlighting is GREAT.  I can very clearly see and read the keys in low, and no light.  I do wish that they could use combined colors, so that I could set one part of the keyboard to one color, and a different part to a different color.  Which really assists in gaming, using keyboard shortcuts.  But for me, that's not a dealbreaker.  I can read them in the dark, and that is what I was wanting.", "  The layout for the specialty keys is \"Fairly\" standard.  Tho the sleep mode key being on F11 and especially the airplane mode being on F12 is something that is not a wise choice as those are pretty common shortkeys for quite a few programs.", "  Mouse:  The mouse functioned quite well, right out of the box.  I do wish that it was set a bit further to the left, in an offset style.  As the butts of my thumbs do pass across the pad.  But for a laptop this size, you get what you get.  The cursor sweeps across the screen quite well, with minimal effort, right out of the box.  Big plus.  It also uses hardwared mouse buttons.  Not corner clicks on the mousepad.  Honestly, thats a HUGE win, IMO.  The corner click system I've never really liked, its an area that collects dust and crud, and has to be cleaned.  Whether this suits you or not, well, that's individual taste ;)", "CON: This mousepad collects oil.  It collects oil REALLY bad.", "  Weight:  This machine is VERY PORTABLE.  The weight is quite light.  I was actually very surprised when I opened the box.  I almost wondered if there was something missing.", "  Between the machine itself, and the power brick, this is QUITE light.  My Sager laptop is a brick.  The powerbrick is huge and weighs a ton.  This machine is most definitely a very welcomed upgrade from that!", "  Noise:  This machine really surprised me as far as the (lack of) noise from the fans.  I have had cooling pads with fans in them that have made more noise than the cooling system in", "  this machine!  ASUS has really outdone themselves with the cooling system.  Tho as stated, I haven't tried gaming on this thing yet.  But so far, the noise level from this is", "  quite pleasant, and very unobtrusive.  [Edit] Ok, so the fans have kicked on.  They are no means loud, compared to some of the other laptops that I have owned.  It's actually pretty subdued, for laptop fans.", "Somebody else had mentioned that they sound kind of like airplane turbines.  Yeah!  They actually kind of do! :D  Which is cool!  But again, they're fairly quiet.  I seriously doubt that they would bother anybody except for maybe a fairly light sleeper.", "  Heat:  Again, a very pleasant surprise!  I've run this machine a straight, solid 24 hours, and have not had the fans kick on high.  There is no hot air blowing out of the side ports, and it's extrememly comfortable on the lap.  (One of my HP laptops has literally left bald spots on my legs from the heat!)", "  Upgrades:  There are two slots for RAM.  Which are the standard open the clips, slide the new one in/out variety.  This makes upgrading the RAM very simple.  There are two slots for m2 type Solid State boards, which are spaced widely apart.  This is not only making it very easy for install/removal, but also for heat control.", "  Next to the battery, (NOT removable!) [Edit]  (The battery IS removable.  Just not externally like older laptops.  You have to open it up, disconnect it, and then it can be removed/swapped. )  There is a connector for a 2.5\" SATA drive.  Which included connectors.  I myself don't like the idea of putting a drive that close to the battery.  But considering how little this machine is, and how little space there is inside... it has to go somewhere, right?  And at least, we can add a 3rd drive!", "  Boot up:  With the operating system installed on a SSD, this machine boots up really fast.  Granted windows will really slow it down when it decides to do a mandatory update.", "  But without those, I press the power up button and within seconds, I'm typing in my password.  Very nice!", "  Speed:  So far the processor/RAM/SSD combination is a winner.  Even Adobe Photoshop CS6 fires right up.  Haven't tried it with gaming so far, but so far, my intensive programs aren't suffering any kind of slow-down, stuttering, or lag.  The exception to this is my browser.  I run A LOT OF TABS when I am surfing.  And browsers are heavy RAM hogs.  Yeah, one of my browsers is getting a lot of hesitation.  But that will go away when I upgrade RAM.", "CONS", "  Size:  As I said before, this is a very small, portable machine.  In that aspect it is fantastic!  However.  The palm rest is small enough that if you use an external mouse  there is VERY little room on the palmrest to put a mouse on it, much less use it.  I am constantly running the mouse over the arrow keys and part of the numpad.  This has caused me problems as those keys interact with programs, when I don't want them to!  This for me, is a huge con, as I really do use a laptop ON my LAP.", "  The screen is also small.  While I don't have very good eyes anymore, it's clear and easy to read.  But for some of the applications that I use my machines for, a larger, external monitor is going to be a must.", "  Windows 11:  This is a personal choice.  I myself believe that Microsoft went in a very, very bad direction with the latest release of their OS.  I will be backtracking the Operating System on this machine backwards to Windows 10 at the very first opportunity.  [Edit]  I really do hate this operating system.  The look of it is similar, but much different in ways that I don't like.  I also do not like the way that MS did the new taskbar.  The right click context menus are also way, way different, and very much not to my liking. [Edit] I found how to revert the context menus, looking around on the web.", "Especially since the changes that they made to the right click context menus are NOT compatible with a lot of the software that I use.", "  Disassembly:  Ok.  This is a pro/con situation.  Taking this machine apart to get to the guts is actually really simple.  There are 11 screws holding the plate underneath to", "  the machine.  They are easy to take out, and the plate is fairly easy to remove.", "  HOWEVER.  These screws are all different lengths!  So you HAVE to keep track of which one goes where!", "  NON-Removable  External battery:  This is an obvious con.  Not only can you not carry around a spare, but you cannot easily replace the existing one, if it goes bad. [Edit] As I noted before, yeah the battery can be replaced, but you have to open up the lower shell.  It's not a hot swappable battery that we got used to on older machines.", "  RAM slots.  Ok, this was a huge let down for me.  I was planning to simply take out the RAM from the machine that died, and put it in here to upgrade the low 8gb of ram that", "  it comes with.  It doesn't FIT!!  The pin arrangement is different, and the slot in the board is spaced further to the left.  I will have to look up what RAM this thing takes and purchase new boards to perform the upgrade.", "HOWEVER.  And this... this is awesome.  There's only ONE 8gb stick in this machine, when it arrived.  NOT paired 2x 4gb sticks.  What that means is that I can just throw another 8gb stick in here, and double the memory.  Without having to sacrifice a stick that was already in it.  Because it wasn't already in it!  Or, I could just throw in a single 16gb stick and instantly TRIPLE the ram, at significantly less coss.  I'm reading conflicting information about how much this machine supports.  Most say it's 32gb, while some say 64gb.", "I am more inclined to believe 32, but I don't know for sure.", "  Expansion slots:  Pretty much all of the connectors for USB, Video Out, and audio are all on the left side.  This, since an external monitor is going to be a must, will cause", "  some arrangement problems.  It could cause problems for people that also will be using this on a desk.  One thing that I love about my older Dell laptops is that they have some", "  of the afore mentioned ports at the BACK of the machine.  Or at the Rear Corners.", "  More USB ports would also be a very nice addition.", "  No Optical Drive.  Maybe I'm just a dinosaur, but I do miss having an optical drive bay.  Being able to watch DVDs or burn disk was a habit from way back in the day.  Or just taking the tray out, and swapping in a 2.5 sata drive through an adapter was also a very seriously nice option.  Ahhhh, progress LOL.", "  8 Gb of ram:  This combined with Win11, the LOAD of software marked with ASUS, and that crapware McCaffee pre-installed...  the machine is running at around 50% memory usage.  The Asus Monitoring software, along with the bloated goat OS is taking up quite bit of the system memory.  After uninstalling worthless McCaffee, I've cut it down to about 40% with 8gb RAM.", "  And as stated above, this machine takes different RAM boards than those used by machines from a few years ago.", "  512 GB Solid State Storage:  Ok.  This is a pro/con situation.  512 is quite good, in comparison to what similar machines are offering, which is half that.  At the same", "  pricepoint as these machines.  And as mentioned above, the machine will support up to 1tb storage boards, or SATA drive.  So there is definitely room for expansion with this machine.  However, to do so, IS an added expense.  And if you are planning on adding on a lot of games to this, you are definitely going to want to expand on the storage capacity!  Fortunately, it does have a sata slot.  Which means that you can add in a 1tb sata drive for considerably less money.", "Overall, the only thing that I'm going to complain about, is the size of the palm rests.  It's very comfortable for typing on.  But, as most of the applications that I use, I need those concise, accurate mouse movements.  And not having room to use a mouse on this machine is going to be a problem.", "That, and having to purchase windows 10 and what I will have to go through reinstalling drivers.  But again, that's a personal choice.", "Well , where to begin, \u2026.. I review a lot of tech in my profession and I am very impressed with this product.", "  I initially bought this for business and of course the occasional gaming ;) This thing is a beast still ! I upgraded the ram to 32gb and everything else I kept the same and it\u2019s handled everything I\u2019ve thrown at it from games AAA titles to video editing and much more .", "  Now,  the CPU/GPU is not the newest it\u2019s about 2 years old in the tech world but it still packs a punch, starting from the seller , to deliver , and presentation , it came in perfect condition.It\u2019s been a long time since I had not a single complaint. This was the smoothest purchase I have had in a while .", "  The build quality is great , the I/O has everything you need , it\u2019s all around a total package. I\u2019d say it\u2019s great for the average Joe to a power user.", "  It also is future proofed as everything is upgradable which is also nice. It has a ram card of DDR4 3200mhz that can be maxed out to 60gb\u2019s and super easy to work on. I can happily answer any regular or advanced questions for anyone that has them. This honestly was a steal for the price and a 2 year warranty.", "  I love the screen, it has the matte finish to cut down on glare, I am also glad the laptop is backlit, and I can put it to one color although it can pulse , strobe and a slew of other options  but I always felt RGB screams \u201ca 14 year olds first game rig\u201d which I am sure gamers will get it, so it\u2019s nice to choose a color and stay there.  The keyboard and trackpad is super responsive, and feel nice.  I was actually really impressed with the sound quality as I also use a MacBook Pro for business and they just have great sound but this ASUS just romps ! It sounds good .", "  Another nice thing was it\u2019s actually is as advertised, no surprises and it is specked out the way it said it was . My only suggestion is to immediately jump up to 16gb of ram and you can buy it as a bundle, I\u2019d suggest the \u201ccrucial\u201d brand of ram sticks they have never let me down or had any compatibility issues.", "  Obviously there isn\u2019t a whole lot I can say that the posting does not but I can say once actually getting it in your hands the listing doesn\u2019t do it justice , it\u2019s really nice. I\u2019ll say it again the seller was great , I had it rushed shipped and it was here earlier than planned, the box and presentation was spot on and the PC performs , isn\u2019t that what it\u2019s about ?", "  It does the job and it\u2019s durable and well made. If your looking for a entry level gaming laptop that realistically can be upgraded to a mid range gaming PC , this is it . I saw the 2022 version of this TUFF laptop and honestly you\u2019d be best getting this one at this price point which is a late 2020 model and Its basically the same laptop other than internals( obviously). If there was one thing I would like to have change is the bloat these companies put on the PC. I really don\u2019t mind windows 11 it\u2019s a welcomed change. I requested a clean install , unfortunately and I get it , it\u2019s just business and the way these companies work together to make money but it would have been nice to not have to wipe it and debloat the machine. However I will always recommend to do so anyway as it makes a huge difference. That\u2019s really the only meh vibe I had to say about this awesome product and let\u2019s be real , there will always be bloat from anywhere you buy new machine from. Just run a clean install of win11 and you\u2019re golden!", "  Before I forget the battery life is actually pretty good I saw others saying otherwise but again a clean install of windows 11 will definitely improve that, the screen has a decent brightness maybe if it had 1 more level up it would be perfect otherwise this is as close as to a all inclusive total package your gonna get.", "  Great price for a great machine . Best of luck and I hope this helps someone make a decision, if you have questions feel free to ask away , I\u2019m a straight shooter and happy to help! Happy Holidays!", "Pros:  Excellent Purchase. I replaced this ASUS with a previous ASUS laptop that I own, in which it still works very well. The back screen panel was cracked and I put duck tape on it to keep it from cracking when I closed it. But it never affected the functionality. I only purchased another ASUS due to working remote at times and I need to have something ready if it completely broke. I had the previous ASUS laptop for maybe 7 years or longer. That is good quality. I previously had a HP (before that ASUS) and that thing got so much virus activity that it could never work efficiently. When I got that ASUS - I knew it was the best purchase. I had that ASUS updated for space and it ran so fast I never wanted to replace it. This is why I kept using that laptop. Best purchase I ever made, thanks to my son telling me to purchase that ASUS. Once again, my son chose this  ASUS laptop as a replacement for my old ASUS. I am not a gamer (but he is), but a person that streams and need a lot of speed to work fast. This laptop is great. I like the picture screen pixel. Clear. The speed is magnificent. Everything was easy to set up. My son started it and set it up and added google chrome and I set up all other things that I used. It was easy to do. It is fast and efficient. I am not a gamer so I can't tell you about that. The fan, you can hear it when it is working. It doesn't bother me. It doesn't come on all the time. The keyboard lights up. The windows 11, I like, but I haven't used it to its full potential. I am pleased with this purchase. I will always invest in ASUS laptops if I ever need another one. Now I have 2 fully functioning ASUS laptops.", "Overall the laptop is great and ability to expand and upgrade ram and storage is a huge plus at this price point.  However the pictures on the listing as of today Jan 11 2023 state it has a 90Wh battery.  This is false it only contains a 48Wh battery.  Amazon is the only place I have been able to find that list this particular model with a 90Wh battery.  Asus has also confirmed that this model doesn't not have the option for 90Wh battery and comes from the factory at 48Wh.  I belive Amazon has used the stock photos of another laptop in this listing by mistake.  Amazon offered to refund my money if I sent the item back in but I already have it set up and I do not completey trust that reseting it back to factory or reinstalling windows is secure enough after having my personal info already on it.", "I actually bought this from Amazon's Warehouse as a return - and I am so glad I did.  I love this laptop.  My 70+ pound Great Pyrenees stepped on it when closed and left a huge scratch in the cover and it didn't affect the machine at all!  The case is truly tough, and with 4 dogs, that was a requirement.  As far as operating system, it's fast, does everything I need it to, and has a good battery life.  The keyboard is a bit different, definitely geared towards gaming, but I like having a numbers keyboard again (my last few laptops did not).  The only downside to this laptop is the weight - I had gotten used to very thin, light weight laptops.  However, in the end, the need for a good, tough case outweighed (literally) my desire for a light weight laptop.  I would definitely recommend this laptop.", "There is very little to dislike, the display is very clear and bright. It runs very smooth, even when playing a taxing game. Though I have noticed that games tend to load up very slow if the PC is not plugged in. I'm sure it has something to do with power saver mode. I love the backlite keyboard, and dedicated WASD keys. I am missing a finger on my left hand and the way the keys are configured makes it a lot easier to play when a controller can not be used. Honestly I was very hesitant about buying this laptop. I have been traveling a lot lately for work and this thing has just been great to have on long trips and boring days in my motel room.", "--Note, after 3 weeks of owning i decided to return this. I stand by my review, i feel the laptop is good for casual gaming, but i ended up wanting to PC game full time, and this wasn't going to cut the mustard.", "This is my first gaming PC, and overall its good.", "For the price, i think its a great snag, BUT if you plan on using this PC as your main gaming station, or plan on playing every game out there, id buy something else.", "This PC has run every game ive thrown at it, but it runs noticeably worse when running newer games, or higher demanding games.", "You wont be getting 144 frames on majority of games without dropping every graphics setting to low, and even after that you most likely will not get 144 frames.", "Max i was able to get for Insurgency Sandstorm was 80ish, Ready or not 80ish,  Death Stranding 60, Madden 23 60, Apex Legends 120s, GTA 4 60s. I had to run these games on low settings to get these frames, and it wasn't steady. I was dropping down to the 20-30 ALOT when playing Insurgency and Ready or Not. Even GTA4 was pretty janky while driving and shooting.", "I got max Frames in Valorant, Counter Strike GO, and all older games like Fallout 4, Skyrim, Left4Dead 2 i was able to play on ultra graphics.", "Graphics card is meh. I can easily notice the graphics dropoff when playing Apex and Madden on here, then hopping on Series X and playing them, its a steep drop off. The issue is you cant play a majority of games on medium or high settings, which also hurts the graphics big time.", "The screen is excellent. Its anti glare, and very clear. Its very well made, but 15inches is quite small, so an upgraded side monitor might be needed.", "Battery is pretty bad, but i usually always have it plugged in. Just web browsing at 50% brightness youre getting 2 hours battery life.", "I see some reviews claiming that the Wifi adapter is bad, i havent experienced this. I game upstairs on wifi, my router is downstairs, and i usually get 25 ping in online games, which is pretty great. I also got 150ish download on steam. Ive never gotten buffering when watching a video, or live stream(I watched the Bills vs Rams game last night on this without any buffering).", "I highly recommend upgrading the ram if you do end up buying, the max this PC can use is 24 RAM, so i installed the Crucial RAM 16GB DDR4 3200MHz CL22, very easy install.", "Speeds for the PC are very fast. From web browsing, to gaming, to tab switching, everything is very fast, even faster than my Macbook 2020.", "Overall its a solid gaming laptop, just go in knowing the limitations going in. Id recommend for casual /light gamers.", "update: had this baby for about a month. I'm an apple fanatic, and I love how integrated Apple makes everything. Texting from my computer is definitely a missed feature for me.", "But alas, I enjoy games and my two macs have trouble running the game, and the screens also both cracked at the same time, making it impossible to play games but still manageable to do other stuff. Again, i'm an apple fanatic but needed a new computer and didn't wanna spend insane amounts of money just for a new computer.", "I have had absolutely no problems out of this computer. It runs league of legends, sims, and steam games flawlessly without needing any adjustments. The computer automatically goes into performance mode when you're playing a game. The other reviewers are correct about how loud it can get with the fans, but it becomes white noise to me eventually. Its not distracting enough to not be ignored, especially if you are already watching something, you'll barely notice it.", "Even with the fans running, my ocmputer does not EVER get hot. This is the first time i've ever had a computer not get severely hot to the touch when gaming for long periods of time.", "The keyboard is so fun to type on, and this computer can handle a LOT of tasks at the same time. I absolutely love it, even if its windows. And now I can play other games, as Apple Store games or others are harder to play on macs.", "If you are considering this as a christmas present for a computer fanatic (me), or someone who plays lots of games (esp multiplayer), they will fall in love with it! And I kinda love how big the screen is. Watching stuff is so nice with this large screen!", "I\u2019m pretty dedicated to the Sims - I\u2019ve got all packs (and like, one kit\u2026kits are dumb) and about 70 gigs of CC including gameplay", "mods. I play Sims 4 on Ultra visual settings and it is FLAWLESS. I have absolutely no idea if this would work for anything outside of Sims or Skyrim, but if you\u2019re here for either of those games, definitely buy it. Just a side note: unless you\u2019re going to upgrade your memory/storage/c drive/whatever it is that maxes out when you download a ton of stuff, I\u2019d stick to one or two games you\u2019re really dedicated to. This thing doesn\u2019t come prepared for a TON of stuff. You\u2019ll need to upgrade if you\u2019re looking for a lot of memory/storage.", "The unit overall is spot on for gaming or most other uses; I really did enjoy it.  The small battery is the weakness of the laptop - very dismal battery life.  A huge plus is that basically, every component can be upgraded.  Rather than changing out the batt and adding ram, I returned it.  My next Amazon laptop will have a larger battery."]},

Highly recommend", "very nice product at all... need to upgrade a lil bit specially the ram though", "For clarity, this review is for the 15.6\" GTX 1650 version, not the 17.3\" GTX 1650Ti version.", "Positives!", "This laptop is perfect for me and what I need right now.
